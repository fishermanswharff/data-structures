The Queue
=============================

Data structures are ways to store data in a computer program. different structures exist because some are faster than others or more suitable for some tasks.

Elements get appended at the end of the structure.
Elements get removed from the beginning of the structure.
How is this data structure called?

A Queue
————————
each thing we put in a queue has a value. 
how does an object know where it is in the queue? 
  based on what's in front or behind it. we add and remove items quickly. 



other structures: 
stack
set
binary tree


Stacks
=============================

what does a stack do?
——————————————————
a stack is just like a queue, but instead of fifo, the stack is last-in, first-out
add elements at the beginning, remove from the beginning.
find its size
Print itself

Adding Nodes
————————
make the new Node point to the current head
make the head of the stack be the new node
Just like in the List class we created, where the addToList() method would add new Nodes at the beginning

To Remove Nodes
———————————————
Make the head of the stack be the second Node in the stack
This way, we are skipping the first Node
And it gets erased from our computers memory by Java

The rest
———————————————
The remaining methods are just liek for the Queue class
Stacks are extremely useful in computers

The Set
======================================

What is a set?

Data cannot be duplicated. Must be unique elements.
There are a number of operations that make sets useful in some scenarios.

What does a set do? 

removeAll(Collection)you can remove all of them. remove from this set all the elements present in the Collection passed as a parameter.
retainAll(Collection)—keeps in this set 

Sets are complicated
———————————————

elements in them are stored without a specific order
every time you print the set out, it would be in a different order
instead of programming our own sets, we will use Java's built-in Set class, which works perfectly
