# Data Structures

Labs include: 

* Queues
* Stacks
* Linked Lists
* Double Linked Lists
* Binary Trees

## What is a trie? 
* Stores characters rather than words, it can store words, but most of the time it stores characters. 
* It depends on the sequence of those characters. 
* Typically used when some pieces of information are shared between sequences. (Sometimes Starts and) ends with an empty node.

## What is a b-tree?
* Typically stores words or other "complete data" (integers, anything in principle, but usually not characters)
* Sequence DOES NOT matter
* Starts with a "full" node (not empty)
